    "    DESIGN PATTERN - Multithreaded Long Tasks GUI\n",
    "    Presents one method for running long-running operations in a PySimpleGUI environment.\n",
    "    The PySimpleGUI code, and thus the underlying GUI framework, runs as the primary, main thread\n",
    "    The \"long work\" is contained in the thread that is being started.\n",
    "    A queue.Queue is used by the threads to communicate with main GUI code\n",
    "    The PySimpleGUI code is structured just like a typical PySimpleGUI program.  A layout defined,\n",
    "        a Window is created, and an event loop is executed.\n",
    "    What's different is that within this otherwise normal PySimpleGUI Event Loop, there is a check for items\n",
    "        in the Queue.  If there are items found, process them by making GUI changes, and continue.\n",
    "    This design pattern works for all of the flavors of PySimpleGUI including the Web and also repl.it\n",
    "    You'll find a repl.it version here: https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Async-With-Queue-Communicationspy\n",
